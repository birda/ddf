     NOTE: This features XML file uses the Karaf "install" attribute to specify whether a feature
     is automatically installed when an app's KAR file is hot deployed.
     
     Description of the install attribute from the Karaf features XSD:
     
     "Installation mode. Can be either manual or auto. Specifies whether the feature should be 
     automatically installed when dropped inside the deploy folder. Note: This attribute doesn't 
     affect feature descriptors that are installed from the command line or as part of the 
     org.apache.karaf.features.cfg."
